# Sprint Review and Retrospective

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

 To interpret user needs, I need to first have a full picture of the client's desired functionality. Once you have the list, break the functionality down into user stories. User stories are important because it breaks down the system functionality in ways that system analysts, developers, and business users can understand (Cobb 2015).
   
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 
 Before decising on a specific SDLC approach, I need to consider my team's current situation. Is this a large or small project? Will the team be small or large and spread across the organization? Once details like that have been ascertained, I will then choose the approach that works before for my team. For example, if there was a small project with a small team and the project has a lot uncertainty, I would choose an agile approach.
   
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
 
  Being a team member means embodying the agile values of commitment, openness, respect, and courage. Even though these are agile values, I strongly believe they are important even in non-agile environments. These values encourage productive collaboration with team members. They should also take pride in their work and understand that each member is equally responsible for producing quality software (Cobb 2015).
